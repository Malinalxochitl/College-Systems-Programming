Workload E:
This workload will alternate between allocating an 8 byte block and a 32 byte block.
After allocating each of these blocks 60 times, the 32 byte blocks are freed.
Then, 60 12 byte blocks are allocated.
The purpose of this workload is to make the memory fragmented with blocks spaced out between each other.
It tests whether malloc can handle allocating memory when the memory is fragmented.

Workload F:
This workload will malloc blocks of size N until malloc returns NULL (not enough memory)
It will then free all blocks, increment N by 1, and repeat this process until N is equal to 150.
The purpose of this workload is to test malloc's capability of handling a large allocation, both in number and size.
