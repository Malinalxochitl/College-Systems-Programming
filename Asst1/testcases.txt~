Workload E:
This workload will alternate between allocating an 8 byte block and a 32 byte block.
After allocating each of these blocks 60 times, the 32 byte blocks are freed.
Then, 60 12 byte blocks are allocated.
The purpose of this workload is to create a fractured memory with blocks spaced out between each other.
It tests whether malloc can handle allocating with the memory broken up into multiple sections of free memory.

Workload F:
This workload will malloc blocks of size N until malloc returns NULL (not enough memory)
It will then free all blocks, increment N by 1, and repeat this process until N is equal to 150.
The purpose of this workload is to test malloc's capability of handling large amounts of memory allocations.
It also tests how malloc will handle more allocations than memory can provide at various byte sizes.
